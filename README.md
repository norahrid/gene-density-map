# Gene density map
This visualization tool displays the gene density of the Arabidopsis genome using React and p5.js as an initial development project in my internship with the HCI lab at USask. It is the grandfather application to the [Literature Comparison Browser](https://github.com/norahrid/literature-comparison-browser).
